# GatewayClient

This library is a ruby gem for interacting with a Ripple
Gatewayd daemon / api server.

After setting up a gatewayd server, use its public ip
address, admin username and api key to instantiate a new
gateway client object in ruby, and interact with the gatewayd
http api at your will.
